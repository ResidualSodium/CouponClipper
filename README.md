# Digital CouponClipper

Coupon clipper is run through Selenium webdriver. The program automatically selects your default Google Chrome profile and then presents the user with a pop-up notification asking which website you would like to clip coupons from. 

Since CouponClipper uses the default Google Chrome profile as the driver when clipping coupons, you must ensure that you have closed your Google Chrome broser, if it is actively being used, before running the program. **If you do not close your Google Chrome browser prior to running the program, it will crash**. Additionally, while it might be tempting to use the browser while the program is running, it is best not to touch anything on the webpage unless it's to log in or type in your password while the "are you signed in" pop-up is active. 

For Giant Eagle and Target, the program uses your defualt browser, it's very likely that if you had signed in previously, you will be able to just move forward. Kroger, on the other hand, has measures in place attempting to mitigate bot traffic. As a reuslt, you will likely need to sign in using your password before clipping coupons on the Kroger website. 

At present moment, Kroger is the only website that has the capabilities of being more targeted. E.g., You can select specific departments that you would like to clip coupons from. Once your selections have been made, the bot will select the same items you did, and then begin clipping coupons. However, if you choose not to make any selections, the program will default and auto-run without any additional targeting of specific departments, brands, or items wihtin the digital coupon section. 

Once a store has been selected, Couponclipper navigates to your requested website, ensures that you are logged in, and then navigates to the websites digital coupon page. From there, CouponClipper begins clipping the digital coupons on that page. 

This project is currently in Beta testing phase. 

# Requirements:
• python3.8 or greater
• Selenium webdriver
• Windows Opperating System
• customTkinter

# Post Beta implementations to be considered:

• Addition of targeting specific brands/departments for Target

• Other websites/stores that offer digital coupons

# Notice
• This code is to be used only by individuals to save you, the user, time and effort when clipping digital coupons. This is not a tool to be distributed or used in mass for the material gain of yourself, others, or any corporation. **Again** this is a tool to be used only by you to save you the time and effort of clipping digital coupons 

# Stores with CouponClipper functionality:

Kroger, Giant Eagle, Target, Ralphs, King Soopers, Food 4 Less, Baker's, City Market, Dillons, Foods Co, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Gerbes, Jay C Food Store, Mariano's, Metro Market, Pay-Less Super Markets, Pick'n Save, QFC, Smith's Food and Drug, Winn Dixie

# Known issues:

• Winn Dixie currently has an issue with coupon clipping for some items. This seems to only impact items that are within 1 day of expiry. These items are not able to even be added manually, and as a result will remain as items that are capable of being clicked. Program will still iterate over the coupons available to be clicked. Items that are incapable of being added end up being unclipped and the program will stop after clicpping all other coupons. 


• Kroger sign on: When attempting to sign into Kroger and/or Kroger brand of companies, some users have an issue that does not allow them to sign on. This is likely the result of Kroger's anti-bot detection. To circomvent this, you will need to close the program, open Google Chrome, and log into your Kroger account. Once completed, close Google Chrome and run the program again. 


• Zipped file: Windows believes that the zipped file is a Trojan. This is not the case. The Zipped file is a .exe that was created with Pyinstaller, and as a result is being flagged as a potential trojan. I need to find a soulition for this and will make the updates once available. For the time being, you can mark the folder/file as being safe for Windows Defender, or, when receivnig the notice that Windows Defender as detected a virus, you can simply ask Windows Defender to allow the file. You'll also need to run the file as Admin at this time. Again, I'm seeking a solution for this and will update once available. Apologies in advance to anyone who attempts to use prior to a fix being implemented.
