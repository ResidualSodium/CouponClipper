# Digital CouponClipper

Clipping coupons for Kroger/Giant Eagle/ Target

Coupon clipper is run through Selenium webdriver. The program automatically selects your default Google Chrome profile, presents a pop-up notification asking which website you would like to clip coupons from. 
Coupon clipper then navigates to your requested website, ensures that you are logged in, ensuring that it clips coupons for your account, and then navigates that page and automatically clips coupons. 
This project is currently in Alpha testing phase. 

# Requirements:
• python3.8 or greater
• Selenium webdriver
• Windows Opperating System

# Post Alpha implementations to be considered:

• Other websites/stores that offer digital coupons
